Starlette is a lightweight [ASGI](https://asgi.readthedocs.io/) framework/toolkit for Python, which is ideal for building high-performance asyncio services. It is production-ready and gives you tools for building APIs, WebSockets, GraphQL endpoints, and more. Many high-level frameworks (like FastAPI) are built on top of Starlette.
