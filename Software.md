# Software 

In software development, "static" typically refers to what is fixed or known beforehand, while "dynamic" means what is changeable or known at runtime. Static testing, for instance, examines code without executing it, while dynamic testing requires running the software to validate its behavior. 


1. **Static Software:** (eg- calender, clock) purpose is to only see the dates/days/time

**Static Website:** (eg- blogs, govt. websites) 

**Definition:**
Static software components or systems are those that are fixed and do not change during runtime. Their properties are determined during the design or compilation phase and remain constant throughout the program's execution. 

**Examples:**
Static Websites: These are websites that have predetermined content and structure, and their pages are served directly from the server without any dynamic processing. For example, a simple HTML page with fixed text and images is a static website. 
Statically Typed Languages: Programming languages like C++ and Java require explicit type declarations, and the type of a variable is determined at compile time. 
Static Binding: In programming, static binding occurs when the call to a method or function is resolved at compile time. This means that the specific implementation to be executed is known when the program is compiled. 
Static Analysis: This involves examining software code without running it, using techniques like code reviews and static analysis tools to identify potential issues like syntax errors or security vulnerabilities. 

2. **Dynamic Software:** (eg- excel)

**Dynamic Software websites:** (eg- instagram, youtube)


Users can do many types of interactions mostly (CRUD opertions) - Create, Retrive, Update, Delete

**Definition:**
Dynamic software components or systems are those that can change or adapt during runtime. Their behavior or properties can be modified based on user input, data, or other runtime conditions. 
Examples:
Dynamic Websites: These websites use server-side languages (like PHP, Python, or Java) to generate content dynamically based on user requests and other factors. For instance, a shopping cart website that displays products based on user selections is a dynamic website. 
Dynamically Typed Languages: Programming languages like Python and JavaScript allow variable types to be determined during runtime, meaning that the type of a variable can change as the program executes. 
Dynamic Binding: In programming, dynamic binding occurs when the call to a method or function is resolved at runtime. This means that the specific implementation to be executed is determined when the program is running. 
Dynamic Analysis: This involves running the software and monitoring its behavior during execution to identify bugs, performance issues, or other problems. 
Dynamic Testing: This type of testing involves executing the software and simulating user interactions to verify its functionality and performance.
